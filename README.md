## Overview

Every day, most of us take our ability to see the world around us for granted. According to World Health Organization, approximately 246 million people have some form of visual impairment and do not see the world as you and I would. We are working on a smartphone application that simulates various visual impairments such as macular edema, age-related macular degeneration, color blindness, cataracts, and glaucoma. The goal of our application is to establish empathy and understanding while educating the user on the challenges a person with a specific visual impairment may encounter.
